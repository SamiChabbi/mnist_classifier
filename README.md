# MNIST Classification Project

This project implements a handwritten digit classification system using the MNIST dataset with a neural network built using TensorFlow and Keras. The accompanying Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) provides detailed pedagogical explanations, serving as a revision guide.

## Project Contents

1. [MNIST Neural Network Classifier - Python Script](mnist_classifier.py)
   - Python script containing the code for creating, training, and evaluating the classification model.
2. [MNIST Neural Network Classifier - Jupyter Notebook](mnist_classifier.ipynb)
   - Jupyter notebook detailing the data loading, preparation, model construction, training, evaluation, and confusion matrix generation processes.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure the required dependencies are installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamiChabbi/mnist_classifier.git
cd mnist_classifier
```
2. Install these dependencies using the provided [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Python script or open the Jupyter notebook:

   - For the Python script:

     ```bash
     python mnist_classifier.py
     ```

   - For the Jupyter notebook, execute the cells one by one.

**Note:** For detailed explanations about the project, refer to the Jupyter notebook [mnist_classifier.ipynb](mnist_classifier.ipynb). The notebook contains pedagogical information to understand the MNIST classification process.
