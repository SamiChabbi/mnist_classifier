# MNIST Classification Project

This project implements a handwritten digit classification system using the MNIST dataset with a neural network built using TensorFlow and Keras. The accompanying Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) provides detailed pedagogical explanations, serving as a revision guide.

## Project Contents

1. [MNIST Neural Network Classifier - Python Script](mnist_classifier.py)
   - Python script containing the code for creating, training, and evaluating the classification model.
2. [MNIST Neural Network Classifier - Jupyter Notebook](mnist_classifier.ipynb)
   - Jupyter notebook detailing the data loading, preparation, model construction, training, evaluation, and confusion matrix generation processes.

## Installation Instructions

Ensure the required dependencies are installed by running the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Execution Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

2. Run the Python script or open the Jupyter notebook:

   - For the Python script:

     ```bash
     python mnist_classifier.py
     ```

   - For the Jupyter notebook, execute the cells one by one.

3. Follow the instructions in the script or notebook for data preparation, model construction, training, evaluation, and result visualization.
